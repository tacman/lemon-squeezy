# Complete the Checkout

I just bought *another* awesome product in our online store, and when I finished
checking out, LemonSqueezy gave me a success message:

> Thanks for your order!

It's short, sweet, and to the point, but is there a way to customize this if we
need to? Yep! *And* it's product-specific.

Over in the dashboard, click on "Store"... "Products"... "Choose a product", and
in the "Confirmation modal" section down here, find the "Title" and "Message"
fields. We have some default text here - the *same* text we saw in the
confirmation message earlier.

I'm pretty happy with the default text at the moment, even if it *could* use a
few more exclamation points because I'm so excited, but I'll leave it the way it
is for now. If you *do* decide to change this text, remember that the changes
you make here will only apply to this specific product, so if you want *all* of
your products to reflect your changes, you'll have to customize them one by one.

The same goes for this button. We can change *its* text and link here. The
default link looks like it goes to a my-orders page. If we click on that... yep!
We're on the LemonSqueezy order page.

I want to customize this to go back to *our* app after.

## Clear the Cart after Purchase

First though, we have a bug.

Over on our site... the product we just bought is *still* in the cart. We
need to make sure the cart is cleared after we make a purchase. To do that, over
in `OrderController`, create a special action. We'll call it `success()`. Then,
register the route with
`#[Route('/checkout/success', name: 'app_order_success')]`. This will be where
we redirect customers after completing the LemonSqueezy checkout.

Now, to avoid *direct access* to this page, we're going to use a little trick.
Inject `Request $request` and, inside, add
`$referer = $request->headers->get('referer')`. Then, create a variable -
`$lsStoreUrl` - and set it to the store URL. For that, go to the dashboard, open
the storefront, copy the URL, and paste it in our code
`https://squeeze-the-day.lemonsqueezy.com'`.

Below, add `if (!str_starts_with($referer, $lsStoreUrl))`. If this is *true*,
that means someone opened this URL *directly*. In this case, redirect them to the homepage
with `return $this->redirectToRoute('app_homepage')`. Inject
`ShoppingCart $cart` and, below, continue with `if ($cart->isEmpty())`.
Again, redirect to the homepage with
`return $this->redirectToRoute('app_homepage')`. *Otherwise*, clear the cart
with `$cart->clear()`.

We *could* render a separate success page with some details if we wanted to, but
for now, we'll keep it simple and just add a flash message -
`$this->addFlash('success', 'Thanks for your order!')` - and
`return $this->redirectToRoute('app_homepage')`.

Okay, now we need to add this URL to the "Button link" field for each and every
product. *Bummer*. There *has* to be an easier way to do that, right?
Thankfully, *yes* - with an *API option*.

In the API docs, search for "Create a checkout". Under `product_options`, check
out this `redirect_url`:

> A custom URL to redirect to after a successful purchase.

*That's* exactly what we're looking for!

In our code, open the `createLsCheckoutUrl()` method, and below, add:
`$attributes['product_options']['redirect_url'] = $this->generateUrl('app_order_success', [], UrlGeneratorInterface::ABSOLUTE_URL)`.

Okay, head over and check out again. Enter the card info and the billing
address, click the "Checkout" button, and wait for the confirmation modal to pop
up. Here it is! If we click "Continue"... yes! We see the "successful" flash
message - "Thanks for your order!" - and the cart is completely empty now.
Woohoo!

Next: Before we make *more* API requests, let’s separate LemonSqueezy's business
logic from the controller and *centralize* it in a standalone service.
