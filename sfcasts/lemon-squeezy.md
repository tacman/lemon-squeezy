# Chapter 1:  Meet LemonSqueezy - Your Merchant of Record.

Hello and welcome to another E-commerce tutorial! There’re a lot of payment processors available over the internet so selling products online is easy and exciting… until you realize that handling payments, taxes, and compliance is, well, not exciting. At all.

Can we simplify all that tax problems? You bet! You have to find a Merchant of Record (MoR). But what is that? What does that mean? That’s the same payment processor you know but with some superpowers. Merchant of Record means they handle all the complicated legal and financial stuff for you, so you can focus on building and selling your product.. and getting more revenue. No more VAT headaches, no compliance nightmares — just sweet, sweet selling.

And you know what? We found one for you! Meet a squeezed lemon!… um, I mean, LemonSqueezy. A modern and stylish payment processor with awesome UI that will be your Merchant of Record. As bonus, it also has PayPal integration for both individual product purchases and subscriptions which means your customers may choose if they want to pay you by card or via PayPal - no more need to integrate different processors for this, yay!

But before we start, I have to mention that LemonSqueezy might not fit your business. Yeah, this may sounds a bit unfortunately keep in mind that with LemonSqueezy you can’t sell *everything*. I mean, you can sell products and subscriptions, but it works only for software products, no physical products supported. That’s why it ideally fits digital companies like my business! Which one? I will tell you in a minute!

OK, fIrst of all, we need to register to be able to start selling products. Click on the "Get started" and you will need to type your name, email address, and come up with a very secured password, you know, because we deal with payment stuff (though you can also configure 2FA later for more security), and the last but not least - you will need your future store name. Btw, please, use your real email because you will need to confirm it in order to start. And we’re also going to get some test emails from LemonSqueezy on it during this course.

## A Quick Tour of the dashboard

I’ve already registered it, so I will just to go back and sign in using my credentials. And welcome to my "Squeezy the Day" store - I already have some data on my dashboard chart just because I used it while was preparing this tutorial, yours should be completely empty.

When you register - you will get the Setup page that contains several steps you will need to complete to get your live store up and running... but we can postpone those details for later and already start working on our integration in test mode.

Btw, this little "Test mode" switch below in the left sidebar tell us that we're in a testing mode where we can use test card numbers to simulate payments without need to actually pay real money which should help us on our way because I’m going to spend a lot of money on it while developing, and thankfully, just virtual money) As soon as you finish the setup steps and activate your store - you will be able to switch between your live (real) store and test (fake) store using this switch.

Well, technically, you even don't need any website to start selling with LemonSqueezy, isn't that cool? You can just share your LemonSqueezy storefront URL with your customers, and they will be able to buy your products directly from there. But what are we going to sell? Let’s create our first product and start getting profit.

## Create a Product

Now that our test store is up and running, it’s time to do what we came here for: sell something! But first go to "Store" > "Products" and create a "New Product". Because I have a lemonade business that you may guess from the store name - let’s name the first product as "Classic Lemonade". And set description as "A classic citrus lemonade".

Now choose the pricing model  - there are a few of them. A "Single payment" that charges customers a one-time fee. A "Subscription" -  something that will see in the next course. A more specific so-called "Lead magnet" that allows access for free. And "Pay what you want"  that allows you to set a suggested and minimum prices and let your customers decide how much they want to pay for your product.

I will go with the simple one - single payment. And let’s keep it simple and choose the "Standard pricing" model with the price - how about $0.99. In the tax category we need to choose one of few options, and the best that fits our needs is "Digital goods or services (excluding ebooks)" - yeah, didn't you know our lemonade is digital?! As I already told you, since LemonSqueezy is a "merchant of record" - they limit products you can sell via their platform allowing digital products only. So we won’t be able to sell real lemonade (bummer, I know). Instead, let’s create the world’s first digital lemonade! Go change name to "Classic E-lemonade" just for clarity.

You may want to make sure that your product isn’t on their prohibited products list. For this you may want to go to the docs.lemonsqueezy.com, then resources, Help docs, and below there is a prohibited products section: https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/getting-started/prohibited-products . If still not sure about your specific case - just ask their support team.

OK, let’s return back to the product. A good product needs a great image! Upload a delicious lemonade picture that makes people thirsty for… e-lemonade! And I have one! Go download the course code, unzip it, and inside you will find start/ directory, and inside of it - tutorial/ directory with the image we need - choose this one. Let’s choose this one. I will just drop it to the media section. Oh yes, it looks so taste that I already want to buy it! If you sell files - you can attach a file to the Product and your customers will have access to it after the purchase. The same about Links. I will keep it empty. For now, we don’t need any of that, so let’s move on.

Next: Variants. Variants are useful when you have a product with different options like taste, size, color, etc. We will see it later in this course. But since we want to use different image for each lemonade - it makes sense to create it as different products, because variants do not have images. If you're selling license keys - "Generate license keys" switch is what you may need.

And let's show this product on the LemonSqueezy storefront page - it’s enabled by defaults and this will be convenient if you don't have a web store yet. You can customize "Confirmation modal" and "Email receipt" - For now, the defaults work just fine for us. Btw, LemonSqueezy will handle all the emails for you. Every time customers buy something in your store - LemonSqueezy will send them an order email, so no need to handle those complex emails yourself.

Finally, let’s "Publish" the product. Go close the "Product Details". And that’s it, you just created your first LemonSqueezy Product that has a published status and it’s already displayed on the storefront

Next up, let’s see where our customers may see and buy it, and what that LemonSqueezy Storefront is.
