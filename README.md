# Lemon Squeezy Payment Processor

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script for the
[Lemon Squeezy Payment Processor](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/lemon-squeezy)
course on SymfonyCasts.

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Symfony CLI**

https://symfony.com/download

Make sure you have [Symfony CLI installed](https://symfony.com/download).
You only need to install it once on your system.

Symfony CLI is a developer tool to help you build, run, and manage
your Symfony applications directly from your terminal.

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
You only need to install it once on your system.

Install Composer dependencies with:

```bash
symfony composer install
```

> NOTE: You may alternatively need to run `symfony php composer.phar install`,
> depending on how you installed Composer.

**Setup the Database**

Create the database (SQLite by default, but if you want to go with
a different DB server - configure the `DATABASE_URL` env var in the `.env`
file first), then generate a migration, migrate, and load the fixtures:

```bash
symfony console doctrine:database:create
symfony console make:migration
symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
symfony console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

**Build Tailwind CSS**

```bash
symfony console tailwind:build
```

> NOTE: If you use Symfony Web Server below, it will start
> a worker for you that will watch your Tailwind CSS assets.

**Start the Symfony Web Server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server works
even better.

Open a terminal, move into the project dir, and start the web server:

```bash
symfony serve -d
```

> NOTE: If this is your first time using this command, you may see an
> error that you need to run `symfony server:ca:install` first.

Now check out the site at `https://localhost:8000`.

Have fun!

## Have Ideas, Feedback or an Issue?
